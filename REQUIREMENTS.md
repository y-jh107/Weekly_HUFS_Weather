Our project is providing localized weather information around the Hufs campus

There are a few important features we’ve added
A week toggle, which lets users view and compare this week’s and last week’s weather.
On the frontend, we use HTML and CSS to build a responsive, user-friendly UI that adapts well to all devices.--
We’ve chosen to use a Spring Boot backend for handling the data and providing RESTful APIs with seamless integration.
